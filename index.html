    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a software developer in training. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and Python.
        I am looking to create a career in software development. My goal is to tie this career into my hobbies
        which include cars and music. I have worked many types of jobs from a grunt worker in a hotel,
        selling tickets at a movie theater, helping people buy games and electronics at a 
        game store, to being a CSR in a call center. While all of these jobs provided me with plenty of experince 
        in the work force and with customer service, I found a love for tech and computers. I currently work as 
        a data processor. It is more adjacent to what I want to do but not where I want to be forever. </p>
