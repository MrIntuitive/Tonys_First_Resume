    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
        <h2>Clearesult</h2>
        <p>This is where I currently work. I started in 2020 as a temp and worked my way up to
            Senior Level II Processor. My job started as loading customer data into Salesforce for rebate processing. 
            I was quickly exceeding processing goals and was moved to a position that included my own program.
            I then hired on and shortly promoted to a Level II. I was tasked with Service requests which was a QA type
            role that required me to find issues and resolve them that standard processors may have missed or didn't understand.
            I am now on an Upstream team that handles bulk submissions. I am in charge of Submission Issues so I find problems with
            submissions and either fix the issue or report it to IT or program team to be resolved.   
        </p>
        <h2>Zander Insurance</h2>
        <p>I worked at Zander as a CSR for about a year. I started in 2019 and left in 2020. I would feild upwards of 100 calls a day.
            I mostly handled issues having to do with updating passwords or payment issues. This job was an excercise in patience as is 
            customer service role. It was certainly exacerbated by the ambiguity of a phone call. This was another job where I started as a temp and
            was given extra responsibilities shortly after starting. I did not enjoy this job.
        </p>
        <h2>Mega Replay</h2>
        <p>This was one of my first jobs out of High School. I worked at Mega Replay from 2016 to 2018.
            This was easily one of my favorite jobs. I started as a part time register worker and inside of a year was promoted to full time,
            then to what was called a buyer. This was one of my favorite roles as I got to really play into one of my biggest interests which 
            was/is tech. I am a nerd about all things tech related so working with and testing brand new products was a lot of fun.
            The store discouts didn't hurt either.
