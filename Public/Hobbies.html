    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Music
            <p>I have always loved both listening and playing music.
                I started by playing Flute and Saxophone in Highschool and
                learned Bass and Guitar after graduating. I like all kinds of
                music and my playlists are all over the place as far a genre.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Cars
            <p>I drive a NC Miata as a daily driver. This small sports car has been modified
                to provide the purest driving experience with suspension, wheels, and tires.
                I also have a Saab 9-2x that is around 500 horsepower. Two very different machines
                that certainly have their own uses.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Tech
            <p>I am a very proud nerd. I love all things tech related from phones and computers to refrigerators and ovens. I love anything that 
                is improved by or made easiser using technology. I am always trying to get the latest smart phone. I want my house to be 
                completely smart so I can use the google home application to run everything through automation. I built my own pc and have maintained
                it for years; modifying and upgrading.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Cooking
            <p>Another one of my largest loves is cooking. There was a period of time in my life that I needed to stretch my money pretty far. I resorted to
                learning to cook because I was tired of eating awful frozen food. I have taught myself all sorts of techniques and ways of creating beautiful dishes
                that taste incredible using a wide range of ingredients. I spend a ton of time watching Youtube videos about cooking gadgets and recipies. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Media
            <p>I am all about movies and TV shows. I'm pretty basic with being a large fan of Star Wars and Marvel. Most of the standards.
                I love to read as well. Pretty much any form of media is interesting to me in some shape or form.
